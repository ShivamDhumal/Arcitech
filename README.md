Django REST framework (3.0+)
Clone this repository to your local machine:




cd your-project-name
Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):


python -m venv venv
Activate the virtual environment:

On Windows:


assenv\Scripts\activate
On macOS and Linux:


source assenv/bin/activate
Install project dependencies:

Database Configuration
This project uses PostgreSQL as the database by default. You can change the database settings in the settings.py file if you prefer a different database.

Create a PostgreSQL database for the project.

Update the database settings in settings.py with your database details, such as NAME, USER, and PASSWORD.

Apply the database migrations:


python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
Running the Server
You can now start the development server:


python manage.py runserver
The server will start at http://localhost:8000/.

API Endpoints
The following API endpoints are available in this project:

POST /register/: Register a new user.
POST /login/: Log in and get an authentication token.
POST /logout/: Log out and revoke the authentication token (requires authentication).
POST /content/: Create a new content item (requires authentication).
GET /content/: Retrieve a list of all content items (requires authentication).
GET /content/<id>/: Retrieve a specific content item by ID (requires authentication).
PUT /content/<id>/: Update a specific content item by ID (requires authentication).
DELETE /content/<id>/: Delete a specific content item by ID (requires authentication).
GET /search/: Search for content items based on a search query (requires authentication).
Usage
Register a new user by sending a POST request to /register/ with a JSON body containing username, email, and password.

Log in by sending a POST request to /login/ with your credentials (username or email and password). You will receive an authentication token in response.

Use the authentication token to access protected endpoints like creating, updating, and deleting content items, as well as searching for content.

To create a content item, send a POST request to /content/ with the necessary data.

To retrieve a list of content items, send a GET request to /content/.

To retrieve, update, or delete a specific content item, use the respective endpoints /api/content/<id>/ with the content item's ID.

To search for content items, send a GET request to /search/ with a query parameter search containing your search query.

Security Considerations
Authentication: Make sure to keep your authentication token secure. It should be included in the Authorization header of your requests. Example . `Token 35a5f0daa3e7e50b9d8de94b15505ff86e7c7b4a`

Permissions: Ensure that only authorized users can access certain endpoints. The project includes permission checks to restrict access to content based on user roles.
